<h2>Problem 1</h2>

<h2> Model Ship, CruiseShip and CargoShip classes</h2>

Design a ship class that has the following members:

<ol>

 <li>A field for the name of the ship (string)</li>

 <li>A field for the year that the ship was built (string)</li>

 <li>A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators</li>

 <li>A toString method that displays the ship’s name and the year it was built</li>

</ol>

Design a CruiseShip class that extends the Ship class. The CruiseShip class should have the following members:

<ol>

 <li>A field for the maximum number of passengers (int)</li>

 <li>A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators</li>

 <li>A toString method that overrides the toString method in the base class. The CruiseShip class’s toString method should display only the ship’s name and the maximum number of passengers</li>

</ol>

Design a CargoShip class that extends the Ship class. The CargoShip class should habe the following members:

<ol>

 <li>A field for the cargo capacity in tonnage (int)</li>

 <li>A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators</li>

 <li>A toString method that overrides the toString method in the base class. The CargoShip class’s toString method should display only the ship’s name and the ship’s cargo capacity</li>

</ol>

Demonstrate the classes in a program that has a Ship array. Assign various Ship, CruiseShip and CargoShip objects to the array elements. The program should then step through the array, calling each object’s toString method.

Problem 2 <em> </em>Create <em>packages</em> as needed per design

Create classes modeling the purchase of sandwich / sandwiches at a typical sandwich shop. Use three objects: Cashier, Customer, SandwichMaker. (You can add more classes if you want but these three should be present in the project)

Follow the steps to complete the homework:

<ol>

 <li>Create a sequence / flow diagram – This diagram would show how an interaction is initiated. Also it shows which class will initiate which other class</li>

 <li>Indicate what information (if any) is passed between the classes</li>

 <li>Figure out what instance variables will be needed in each of the classes</li>

 <li>Create UML diagrams – The UML diagrams should follow the exact formatting shown in class slides. Submit UML diagrams in a separate folder as images with your code submission.</li>

 <li>Create all the classes</li>

 <li>Create a driver class (SandwichDriver) to test the functionality</li>

 <li>Handle all possible errors with try catch blocks wherever necessary</li>

</ol>
